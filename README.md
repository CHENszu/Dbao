# Dbao
Here, we have built a similar Dbao large model interaction client, which can be applied to the local area network connection of enterprises and provide a front-end and back-end interaction framework for enterprise data privacy and large model interaction.  
The Dbao framework supports parsing images, videos, and various types of text documents. It is also equipped with context memory and various mcp functions (such as parsing web pages, etc.) to build an enterprise-specific RAG knowledge base.
